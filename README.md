Packer scripts for building images in Azure 

## Running this Sample ##

To run this sample:

Ensure you have an active Azure subscription and that the `az` CLI has been installed and authenticated.

These scripts require environment variables to execute properly.  The following are required:

    - AZURE_CLIENTID
    - AZURE_SECRET
    - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTIONID
    - AZURE_TENANTID
    - AZURE_CLOUD
    - AZURE_LOCATION

If you are running Azure Commerical use:
`export AZURE_CLOUD=Public`

If you are in Azure Government:
`export AZURE_CLOUD=USGovernment`

To get the locations you can use execute:
`az account list-locations`

## Helper Script ##
For those of us too lazy to actually set these variables there is a helper script in the `scripts` directory of this repo.  This script requires 'jq' and 'zsh'.  Using this script you can create an Azure authentication file and use it to set the variables above.  It will use a default location and use the current cloud you are logged into for AZURE_CLOUD.

To create an Azure Auth file:
`az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth > my.azureauth`

Once this file is created you can set these variables using the script:
`source ./az-set-azure-environment ./my.azureauth

>Make sure you use `source` to execute the script.  This will ensure the environment variables are maintained in your current shell.

Once the environment is setup correctly you can run the packer scripts normally:
`packer build ubuntu.json`
